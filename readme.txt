You could run the code and see the result by using the three ipynb files.

part1.ipynb is for cluster algorithms on two datasets
part2.ipynb is for dimension reduction algorithms on two datasets and cluster algorithms for reduciton datasets
NN.ipynb is for NN tests including reduciton datasets and new generated datasets whose feature is created by two cluster datasets.
